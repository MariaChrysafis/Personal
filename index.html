                Competitive Programming
            </h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, you can find me doing competitive programming. I go by <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Olympia">Olympia</a> on Codeforces, <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/airamc">airamc</a> on Codechef, and <a href="https://leetcode.com/passionFruitFlower/">PassionFruitFlower</a> on LeetCode. On slate with competitive programming, I also enjoy learning new algorithms. Feel free to check out my short article on <a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/101010">Tree Isomorphism</a> or my slightly denser article on <a href="https://discuss.codechef.com/t/matroids-extending-kruskals-algorithm/91469">Matroid Theory</a>! I am currently working on writing an expository paper on randomized algorithms (expected release date in December).

                Mathematics
            </h3>
            <p>
                Mathematics is my first love. I have qualified for AIME three times since grade 8. Since then, I've branched out from competitive math and started learning more pure math, mostly in Discrete Math (Number Theory and Combinatorics). I'm currently compiling a list of 10+ proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity, so in the meantime, enjoy one of my <a href="http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/pftb2/maria-quadrec.pdf">favorites</a>, due to Ram Murty, which I wrote about as part of my Euler Circle course.

                I've played around with Codeforces API and currently have two projects underway. The first is <a href="projects/cf-rating-basic/cf-rating-basic.html">Codeforces Rating Graph Analyzer</a> and the second is a <a href="projects/cf-rating-compare/index.html">Codeforces Rating Comparator</a>. I have a third ongoing and incomplete project, a to-do-list generator, which you can find <a href="projects/to-do-list/index.html">here</a>.
